# Typeahead Searching with Hotwire

Following [this lesson](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/hotwire-typeahead-searching) from [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/blog), this demo application utilizes an out-of-the-box Rails installation to build a collapsible search-as-you-type text box that expands to show its results in-line while searching, supports keyboard navigation and selection, and only submits requests to our server when there is a search term.
